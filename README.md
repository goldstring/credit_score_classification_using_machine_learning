<h1>Credit score classification</h1>
<h3>üìù Project Description</h3>
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based classification system that categorizes individuals into different credit score brackets ‚Äî such as Good, Standard, or Poor ‚Äî based on their credit-related and financial data. Credit score classification plays a crucial role in the finance industry by helping institutions evaluate creditworthiness, manage risks, and make informed lending decisions.

The dataset used contains various features related to a person's banking behavior, loan history, income levels, and more. By training a model on this data, the system can learn patterns and indicators of creditworthiness, thereby automating the process of credit score assessment.

This solution is intended to minimize manual effort in credit evaluation, enhance decision-making accuracy, and ultimately streamline credit risk management for financial institutions.

Key steps in this project include:

- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Building and evaluating classification models
- Interpreting model results and performance
- (Optional) Deploying the model for real-time usage
